Basically, this project was all about trying to figure out what factors affect sales at Walmart stores. We looked at data from 20 different Walmart locations to see how things like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, inflation rates, and unemployment levels impact how much people buy.
We used some statistical techniques like regression analysis to see which variables were most important for predicting sales. We also made some neat visualizations with scatter plots, bar charts, and line graphs to spot patterns in the data.
Here are the key takeaways from analysis:

Holidays, temperature, and inflation rates had a big influence on weekly sales numbers. However, fuel prices and unemployment didn't seem to matter as much on their own.
That said, when inflation and unemployment were high at the same time, people actually tended to spend more.
Sales were highest in the spring and summer when temperatures were nice and mild. The winter months, despite having big holidays, were the slowest time of year.
Different Walmart stores had pretty different sales performances too.

Based on these insights, we recommended that Walmart should dial back marketing in the winter and really go hard with promotions for spring/summer holidays and events like back-to-school. They should also keep an eye on economic conditions and maybe adjust pricing/promotions accordingly when inflation and unemployment spike.
The overall goal was to give Walmart some data-driven tips on when and how to run the best marketing campaigns to maximize sales throughout the year.
