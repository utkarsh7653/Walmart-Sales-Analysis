# Overview
This project dives into Walmart’s historical sales data to uncover patterns and drivers of weekly sales across 45 stores, with a focus on a subsample of 20 stores to avoid overplotting and ensure clear insights. Conducted as a team effort by Haley Henson, Carly Sprenger, Utkarsh Singh, and Kevin Peng, our goal is to help Walmart predict demand accurately by analyzing the impact of holidays, seasons, and economic factors like CPI and unemployment on sales. Using R, we explore sales trends from February 5, 2010, to November 1, 2012, and provide actionable marketing recommendations based on statistical modeling and visualizations. The analysis tackles Walmart’s challenge of unforeseen demand spikes, particularly around major holidays (Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas), and aims to optimize stock and promotional strategies.

# Features
Our analysis leverages a robust set of R tools and techniques. We use readxl to import the walmart.xlsx dataset, dplyr for data manipulation, and ggplot2 for visualizations like bar plots (store-wise and seasonal sales), scatter plots (sales vs. CPI, unemployment), and a pie chart (sales distribution by temperature category). The corrplot package helps visualize correlations between variables such as Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment. We also employ linear regression (lm) with log-transformed sales to assess variable significance and interactions (e.g., CPI_Un), while lubridate and scales enhance date handling and formatting. Key outputs include seasonal sales comparisons, holiday impact assessments, and store performance rankings.

# Dataset
The dataset, sourced from walmart.xlsx, spans sales data from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01 across 45 Walmart stores, though we focus on the first 20 to streamline analysis. It includes: Store (store number), Date (week of sales), Weekly_Sales (sales in USD), Holiday_Flag (1 for holiday weeks, 0 otherwise), Temperature (in Fahrenheit), Fuel_Price (regional fuel cost), CPI (Consumer Price Index), and Unemployment (regional unemployment rate). Holiday weeks, especially around Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, are critical as they’re weighted five times higher in Walmart’s evaluation due to promotional markdowns. We’ve enriched the dataset by deriving Month, Season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall), Year, and interaction terms like CPI_Un for deeper analysis.

# Analysis
Our approach begins with data cleaning and reduction, narrowing the focus to 20 representative stores to prevent overplotting. We aggregate sales by store and season, calculate means for holiday vs. non-holiday weeks, and categorize temperature into Low (<50°F), Medium (50-75°F), and High (>75°F) bins. Visualizations include a bar plot of total sales by store, a seasonal sales comparison with dollar labels, and a pie chart showing sales distribution by temperature category. Correlation analysis via corrplot identifies relationships between variables, while multiple linear regression models (e.g., log_transformed_weeklysales ~ Holiday_Flag + Temperature + CPI + CPI_Un) test their significance. We refine models by removing insignificant predictors (e.g., Fuel_Price) and adding interactions, ensuring all variables are statistically significant at the 5% level.

# Insights
The analysis reveals several key insights. Holidays boost average weekly sales slightly (e.g., $1,122,888 on holiday weeks vs. $1,041,256 on non-holiday weeks), likely due to gift and grocery purchases. Temperature significantly affects sales, with the 50-75°F range (Medium) aligning with peak profitability in Spring and Summer. CPI negatively impacts sales (higher inflation reduces purchasing power), while the CPI_Un interaction suggests a nuanced effect during economic downturns. Surprisingly, Winter—despite major holidays like Christmas—is the least profitable season, possibly due to post-holiday spending fatigue. Top-performing stores (e.g., the top 5 from the bar plot) showcase exceptional sales, suggesting replicable merchandising strategies. Fuel prices and unemployment alone lack significant direct influence in our models.

# Results
Our final regression model (log_transformed_weeklysales ~ Holiday_Flag + Temperature + CPI + CPI_Un) achieves an adjusted R-squared of 0.08149, with all predictors significant (p < 0.05). Summer and Spring emerge as the most profitable seasons, driven by vacation and back-to-school shopping, while Winter lags despite holidays. The top 5 stores (from the 20 analyzed) outperform others, offering a blueprint for success. Recommendations include scaling back Winter marketing, launching Spring Cleaning and Summer Kickoff campaigns (e.g., discounts on floaties, cleaning supplies), and a Back-to-School push in late Summer. We also advise monitoring unemployment spikes and optimizing pricing during inflationary periods to balance affordability and profit. These strategies aim to enhance Walmart’s demand forecasting and sales performance year-round.
